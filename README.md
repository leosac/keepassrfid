## Hardware Requirements
WARNING: you **need** a reader to communicate with your contactless card! Only few computers have integrated contactless reader by default. If you don't know, you probably don't have one.

Most RFID / NFC readers and chips on the market are supported through the open-source LibLogicalAccess RFID/NFC middleware. See [Supported Hardware](https://github.com/islog/liblogicalaccess/wiki/Supported-hardware).
